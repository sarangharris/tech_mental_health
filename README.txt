Dataset Description​: This dataset contains survey questions regarding mental health in the tech industry. These survey questions span from previous mental health conditions to current employer information. Included in the survey questions are questions on demographics, age, gender identity, and medical coverage.

Questions to Address​: We will try to predict if a given employee currently has a mental health condition that requires medical treatment and also if they have ever sought treatment for a mental health issue from a mental health professional.

Methods​: We are considering experimenting with decision trees and logistic regression since this is a binary classification problem. Feature reduction or regularization methods may be employed due to the large number of features in this data set.
