Dataset Description​: This dataset contains survey questions regarding mental health in the tech industry. These survey questions span from previous mental health conditions to current employer information. Included in the survey questions are questions on demographics, age, gender identity, and medical coverage.

We will attempt to predict: 
1. Have you had a mental health disorder in the past?
2. Do you currently have a mental health disorder?
3. Have you been diagnosed with a mental health condition by a medical professional?
4. Have you ever sought treatment for a mental health issue from a mental health professional?


Methods​: We are considering experimenting with decision trees and logistic regression since this is a binary classification problem. Feature reduction or regularization methods may be employed due to the large number of features in this data set.
